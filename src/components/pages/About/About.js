            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Laureni. I’m a Full Stack Developer seeking a new challenging
            career. My years of experience in sales and marketing taught me how to listen to client's needs and project
            management; I'm looking to leverage these skills for my next role. I am a hardworking individual passionate
            about approaching programming challenges from different angles and I am always eager to learn new skills and
            advance my knowledge base. </p>
            <p>I've worked on solo projects integrating responsive web design practices and in a
            group incorporating various APIs. I’m completing Rutger's Full Stack Bootcamp, curriculum includes the
            following technologies:
            <li> Browser Based Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap)</li>
              <li> Databases (MySQL, MongoDB)</li>
              <li> Server Side Development (Node.js, Express, MERN Stack)</li>
            </p>
            <p>
              In my personal time I like to bake, ride my bike, and play Animal Crossing. Also, I have a BA in Italian
              literature from New York Univeristy so I love practicing my Italian whenever I can.
          </p>
